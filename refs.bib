abstract = {In this paper, we describe SymDiff, a language-agnostic tool for equivalence checking and displaying semantic (behavioral) differences over imperative programs. The tool operates at the level of an intermediate verification language Boogie, for which translations exist from various source languages such as C, C# and x86. We discuss the tool and the front-end interface to target various source languages. Finally, we provide a brief description of the front-end for C programs.},

abstract="Verifying code equivalence is useful in many situations, such as checking: yesterday's code against today's, different implementations of the same (standardized) interface, or an optimized routine against a reference implementation. We present a tool designed to easily check the equivalence of two arbitrary C functions. The tool provides guarantees far beyond those possible with testing, yet it often requires less work than writing even a single test case. It automatically synthesizes inputs to the routines and uses bit-accurate, sound symbolic execution to verify that they produce equivalent outputs on a finite number of paths, even for rich, nested data structures. We show that the approach works well, even on heavily-tested code, where it finds interesting errors and gets high statement coverage, often exhausting all feasible paths for a given input size. We also show how the simple trick of checking equivalence of identical code turns the verification tool chain against itself, finding errors in the underlying compiler and verification tool.",

abstract = {We propose a new design for a Translation Validation (TV) system geared towards practical use with modern optimizing compilers, such as LLVM. Unlike existing TV systems, which are custom-tailored for a particular sequence of transformations and a specific, common language for input and output programs, our design clearly separates the transformation-specific components from the rest of the system, and generalizes the transformation-independent components. Specifically, we present Keq, the first program equivalence checker that is parametric to the input and output language semantics and has no dependence on the transformation between the input and output programs. The Keq algorithm is based on a rigorous formalization, namely cut-bisimulation, and is proven correct. We have prototyped a TV system for the Instruction Selection pass of LLVM, being able to automatically prove equivalence for translations from LLVM IR to the MachineIR used in compiling to x86-64. This transformation uses different input and output languages, and as such has not been previously addressed by the state of the art. An experimental evaluation shows that Keq successfully proves correct the translation of over 90\% of 4732 supported functions in GCC from SPEC 2006.},

abstract = {K is an executable semantic framework in which programming languages, calculi, as well as type systems or formal analysis tools can be defined, making use of configurations, computations and rules. Configurations organize the system/program state in units called cells, which are labeled and can be nested. Computations carry “computational meaning” as special nested list structures sequentializing computational tasks, such as fragments of program; in particular, computations extend the original language or calculus syntax. K (rewrite) rules generalize conventional rewrite rules by making explicit which parts of the term they read, write, or do not care about. This distinction makes K a suitable framework for defining truly concurrent languages or calculi, even in the presence of sharing. Since computations can be handled like any other terms in a rewriting environment, that is, they can be matched, moved from one place to another in the original term, modified, or even deleted, K is particularly suitable for defining control-intensive language features such as abrupt termination, exceptions, or call/cc. This paper gives an overview of the K framework: what it is, how it can be used, and where it has been used so far. It also proposes and discusses the K definition of Challenge, a programming language that aims to challenge and expose the limitations of existing semantic frameworks.}
