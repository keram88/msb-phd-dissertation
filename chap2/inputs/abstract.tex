Rust is an emerging systems programming language with guaranteed memory safety
and modern language features that has been extensively adopted to build
safety-critical software.
%
However, there is currently a lack of automated software verifiers for Rust.
%
In this work, we present our experience extending the SMACK verifier to enable
its usage on Rust programs.
%
We evaluate SMACK on a set of Rust programs to demonstrate a wide spectrum of
language features it supports.
