\section{Related Work}

In SymDiff~\cite{lahiri2012symdiff} the authors looked at making a tool to compute a \textit{symbolic difference} between two versions of the same program.
%
This is done for C programs translated to the Boogie IVL.
%
The SymDiff tool shows portions of code that have identical behavior, while finding semantic differences between the two programs.
%
Because it operates on Boogie IVL, it is possible that SymDiff could be applied to cross-language comparisons.

In~\cite{transval}, a tool K\textsc{eq} based on the $\mathbb{K}$~\cite{ksemfram} which is used to check translation validation of compiled code.
%
In this work, the authors develop a tool to check equivalence of translations from C to LLVM and from LLVM to x86 binary code.
%
This tool uses the $\mathbb{K}$ framework similarly to how SMACK or SymDiff use LLVM IR/Boogie as a common language for verification.
%
Because the use of this common language for verification, the authors are able to do cross-language equivalence checking on code generated by a compiler.
%
This tool could be extended to support cross-language verification as in this work through the use of LLVM IR.

In~\cite{diffkemp} the authors devlop a tool called D\textsc{iff}K\textsc{emp} which is meant to test equivalence of changes made to the Linux kernel and \texttt{musl}.
%
The tool works by trying to apply \textit{semantic-preserving change patterns} to the code to try to show equivalence, rather than using a solver or an intermediate language.
%
This relates to our guided equivalence checking in that in this work it is used to help the solver find the equivalence of the statements.
%
The techniques in this work could benefit this tool by automatically identifying portions of the C and Rust programs which may be equivalent.
%
This would allow for more scalable verification and less user intervention.

In~\cite{ucklee} a tool based on the \textsc{klee} system, named \textsc{uc-klee}, is developed to check equivalence of functions.
%
The \textsc{klee} system is a symbolic execution which is based on LLVM IR.
%
\textsc{uc-klee} adds equivalence checking extensions which automate making input variables non-deterministic and checking returned values are equal.
%
This work is limited to checking equivalence of functions in one language, but it could be extended to support cross-language verification.
