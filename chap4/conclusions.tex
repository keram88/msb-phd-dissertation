\section{Conclusions}
In this work we showed that SMACK could be used as a practical tool to do equivalence checking between C and Rust programs.
%
We showed that SMACK can find bugs in these programs that may not otherwise be detectable.
%
The floating-point and bit-vector theories proved to be a scalability challenge.
%
We developed techniques to address some of these challenges with varying degrees of success.
%
The equivalence checking extensions made to SMACK made the best improvements to SMACK's scalability, albeit with additional labor.
%
These extensions can be used in the future to do equivalence checking on new libraries, possibly ported between languages.
